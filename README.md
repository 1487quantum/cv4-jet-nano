# Eye(s) of the Jetson Nano

<a href="LICENSE" ><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/license/1487quantum/cv4-jet-nano?style=for-the-badge"/></a>

Exploring OpenCV 4.3.0 & AI with camera(s) & C++ on the Jetson Nano B01.

> **Note:** Compile the OpenCV source before installing ROS!

## Organisation
The directory is split into 3 sections:
- **AI_ML:** AI & Machine Learning related project(s)
- **cpp_proj:** C++ related projects
- **scripts:** Installation & setup scripts

## Scripts
> Scripts are found in the `scripts` directory.

Update the script(s) permissions before running.
```
$ sudo chmod +x 
```
**Note: Ensure that the CUDA compiler (nvcc) is added to ~/.bashrc**
```
$ echo '# Append CUDA tools path' >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}'>> ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}'>> ~/.bashrc
```

### CUDA Sample

The CUDA samples have to be compiled, run `makeCUDAsample.sh` to compile the samples.
> The samples would be copied and compiled at ~/cuda_samples.
```
$ ./makeCUDAsample.sh
```

### Heatsink fan
> Only applicable if an external heatsink fan is attached to the Jetson Nano.

Run `runFan.sh` to turn on the heatsink fan.
```
$ ./runFan.sh
```


### Testing the camera(s)

Make the `runCam.sh` script executable:
```bash
$ chmod + x runCam.sh
```
Test the [camera](https://elinux.org/Jetson_Nano#Cameras) connected via `runCam.sh`:
```bash
$ runCam.sh
```
To test 2 cameras, a `-d` flag would be added:
```bash
$ runCam.sh -d
```

### OpenCV Installation
> OpenCV **4.1.1** is installed in Jetson Nano by default, but without CUDA support. Run `buildOpenCV.sh` to compile & install OpenCV **4.3.0** from source. 

> Source directory is located at `~/`, installation directory is located at `/usr/local/opencv`.
```
$ ./buildOpenCV.sh
```

### ROS Melodic Installation

Run `getROS_melodic.sh` to install ROS Melodic.
```
$ ./getROS_melodic.sh
```


### OpenVSLAM Installation

> Ensure that OpenCV is installed before installing openVSLAM.
Run `getOpenVSLAM.sh` to install OpenVSLAM.
```
$ ./getOpenVSLAM.sh
```

## Compiling the C++ project(s)
> Projects are found in the cpp_proj directory

Each project would be created in a standalone directory, and CMake would be used to compile the cpp files. 
> Ensure that the cpp files & CMakeLists.txt are present in the parent directory before reunning CMake!

### Via Script
Run the script of the target directory:
```
$ ./compile.sh [target_dir]
```
> For example, `$ ./compile.sh cam_fps`

### Manually

Create a `build` directory in the parent directory & enter the directory.
```bash
$ cd parent_dir
$ mkdir build && cd build
```
After that, run `cmake` to generate the Makefiles in the current `build` directory:
```bash
$ cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles' ..
```
After that, compile the files:
```bash
$ make -j4
```
